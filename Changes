Revision history for Perinci-Result-Format

0.38     2014-06-18 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Second attempt, coding mistake.


0.37     2014-06-18 (SHARYANTO)

         - If $Enable_Cleansing is true, do clone-and-clean instead of
           clean-in-place, to avoid modifying e.g. Rinci metadata cache in a
           long-running server.


0.36     2014-02-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - Update for the perl formatter (it adds color by default now, so we
           need to be able to handle/disable it).


0.35     2013-10-24 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add format: phpserialization.


0.34     2013-10-05 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add formats: perl & ruby.


0.33     2013-10-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - text: Colorize error response.


0.32     2013-09-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - text: Show previous errors and stack trace.


0.31     2013-07-05 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add package variable flag $Enable_Cleansing to allow in-place
           cleansing of data that contain items that cannot be handled by
           formatter. For example, JSON cannot handle circular data or complex
           types other than array/hash.


0.30     2013-03-01 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add package variable flag $Enable_Decoration to allow disabling
           colored YAML/JSON output (used by Perinci-Access-HTTP-Server, for
           example).


0.29     2012-12-25 (SHARYANTO) - Merry Christmas!

         - Observe result metadata: result_format_options.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
           growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
