         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add package variable flag $Enable_Decoration to allow disabling

           example).

         Merry Christmas!

         - Observe result metadata: result_format_options.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
         growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
