Revision history for Perinci-Result-Format

0.31     2013-07-05 (SHARYANTO) (not yet released)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add package variable flag $Enable_Cleansing to allow in-place
           cleansing of data that contain items that cannot be handled by
           formatter. For example, JSON cannot handle circular data or complex
           types other than array/hash.


0.30     2013-03-01 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add package variable flag $Enable_Decoration to allow disabling
           colored YAML/JSON output (used by Perinci-Access-HTTP-Server, for
           example).


0.29     2012-12-25 (SHARYANTO)

         Merry Christmas!

         - Observe result metadata: result_format_options.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
         growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
